	<p><i>A Reckoning</i> (2020, Installation, Four channel video total run times 10:49 and 14:48) </p><p> A demonstration of three battles with hierarchy. The first shows three videos of a burning castle, over layed with a subject attempting to block a stream with his body. The second is a pedestal of brick, where a fantasy card game is interrupted by a more animal man. The last is a broken window.</p>

	<p><i>Phase Change: Act I </i> (2019, installation, video run time 25:02)</p><p> The first of a three part year long installation. A stream simulator features a small town decaying as water runs through the sculpture and the show proceeds. It presents erosion, a macro process, which existed long before and will exist long after us, in a micro, observable setting. Demonstrating an attempt at control, it reveals powerlessness. Complementing the interactive sculpture is a documentary exploring cultural, social, and political relationships within the hydrosphere.

	<p><i>Phase Change: Act II&nbsp;</i>(2019, installation, 4 channel video run time 15:01)</p> <p> The second of a three part year long installation. Leaving the wreckage of Act I, we venture back into nature. Act II proposes a full reevaluation; we search for a new life force, floating somewhere in a sea of collapse. In a four channel video opera, three millennials travel and labor to turn water into steam. Enacting a contemporary ritual, they meditate on the phase change and learn from its will. The video is housed in a boat on a sea of brick taken from homes long gone, surrounded by moments, plans, and ideas from the pages of notebooks, diaries, and the ritual’s musical score.

<div id="act3">
	<p><i>Phase Change: Act III </i>(2019, installation, video run time 7:28)</p><p>The third of a three part year long installation. Act III is staircase, unpaving itself in pursuit of becoming. We transform the tools and structure salvaged from the city (act I) to build our own pathway, defining for ourselves what is valuable, useful, and liberating. Patterns form, however, and convention sets in. What was once dynamic and new becomes frozen in repetition. Following our path rather than forging it, we become subservient to the rules that we ourselves created. But liberation is within reach. Tools can again and again have joyous purpose, or no purpose at all. A route headed into stale air can explode. Through childish acts of creative destruction, we can transform. This state will not last, but it will always be there, around a corner, across a plane, beneath rubble. It will be repressed, restricted, covered up, but will never be absent. The ice may not melt, but it can be cracked.

<div id="sleepwalkers">
  <p><i>Sleepwalker’s Song: A Melting</i> (2018, video, total run time 1:42:12)</p>
  <p>A performance for video where the artist slowly melts a large block of ice. An attempt to lean into pain, holding it, affirming it, and thereby overcoming it. </p>

<div id="island">
	<p><i>Time Living On &amp; As: An Island</i> (2017, video, total run time 6:13)</p>
  <p>For this piece, the artist isolated themselves on an island in the Potomac river nightly over the course of two months where he was confronted with the reverence of nature. Working in the style of experimental psychodramas, the film weaves together moments on the island with moments in the city, using water to bridge the two and finding common feelings of loneliness and insignificance. </p>
