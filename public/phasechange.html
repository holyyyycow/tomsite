		<p>Phase Change is a living, evolving installation; a three Act visual story of disaster, transformation, and becoming. The work uses water, steam, and ice, articulated through video, sculpture, and music, as a jumping off point to examine a collective consciousness in crisis and posit a path forward.</p>
		<p>This site specific project was conceived specifically for a twelve month exhibition with each Act unfolding over the course of four months. The sculpture (illustrated above) remains consistent throughout the exhibition, but manifests differently in each Act as a new assemblage of bricks, taken from demolished homes. These formations, and the transitions between them, guide the viewer.</p>
			<p>I believe it is in moments of transition where one can find true becoming. Liquid evaporating to gas, a city turning to moss, a child rebuilding--examining these processes of change provides insight into the creative force of difference as we work towards not just individual transformation but transformation as the collective.
